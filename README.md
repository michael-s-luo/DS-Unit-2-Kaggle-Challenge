# Bloomtech Data Science - Unit 2
## 2.2: Tree-based Models & Kaggle Challenge

This repository serves to document and store my completed projects, assignments, and learning materials from the Bloomtech data science curriculum.

Warm-up Activities, Guided Projects (lectures) and Module Projects (assignments) for unit 2.2 are found in this repository. My completed projects are located in each module's respective folder, the last of which was used as the final submission for the Tanzania water pumps classification challenge on Kaggle.
